I use the global variable with an id, declaring that everyone has the same font-size

#specificity *{
  font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
  font-size: 14px;
}


According to importance (normal or important) and origin (author, user, or user agent). In ascending order of precedence:
user agent declarations
user normal declarations
author normal declarations
author important declarations
user important declarations
Sort rules with the same importance and origin by specificity of selector: more specific selectors will override more general ones. 
The sorting by specifieding order : if two declarations have the same weight, origin and specificity, the latter specified wins. Declarations in imported style sheets are considered to be before any declarations in the style sheet itself.
Apart from the "!important" setting on individual declarations


others options

.box-container .navigation, .box-container .sidebar, .box-container .oh-no-inline-styles, .box-container .item-box-center{
